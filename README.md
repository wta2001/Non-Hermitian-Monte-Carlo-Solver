# Non-Hermitian-Monte-Carlo-Solver
monte carlo quantum jump solver for Lindblad equation written in cpp powered by armadillo 

offers a python api powered by cython to work with qutip along with c++ api to work with armadillo 

with no normalization of state vector or density matrix so is valid for non-hermitian system 

much faster than mcsolver in qutip 

work parallelly on all cpu cores with openMP
